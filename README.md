Built using Java, without any dependencies. Clone locally, open in your IDE of choice, and you're good to go.

### Background

I use my timer a lot. But, there's one thing about it that irks me - it has to be stopped manually. Whenever my timer is done, I find myself dropping everything and running across the room to stop the irritating timer noise as soon as I can.

"Well, in that case, why didn't you just look around to see if there was a timer app that did what you wanted it to?"

Nah, that seemed too hard. I picked the easy route - I made the app myself.

And that's how (and why) I built One Beep Timer.

One Beep Timer is a simple app, with a clean ad-free UI, and straightforward functionality. As the name suggests, it's a timer that beeps once (and sends a notification) to signify that the time is up without requiring any further user interaction.

And that's it - currently. There are definitely additional features that can be added, but I haven't personally found the need for it and so I haven't yet. If you would like to see a particular feature built, or if you'd like to contribute/collaborate, feel free to shoot me an email at thrvg1@gmail.com!
