For those moments when you need a timer that beeps once and stops.

This app is available on Google Play.

Built using Java, without any dependencies. Clone and open in your IDE of choice, and you're good to go!

### Background

I use my timer a lot. But, there was one thing about it that irked me a lot - it had to be stopped manually. Whenever my timer was done, I found myself dropping everything and running across the room to get rid of the irritating timer noise as soon as I could.

"Well, in that case, why didn't you just look around to see if there was a timer app that did what you wanted it to?"

Nah, that seemed too hard. I picked the easy route - I made the app myself. (I still don't know whether there is an app out there that does what my app does haha)

And that's how (and why) I built One Beep Timer.

It is a simple app, with a clean ad-free UI, and straightforward functionality. It is a timer that beeps once (and sends a notification) to signify that the time is up without requiring any user interaction.

And that's currently it. There are additional features I can add to it, but I haven't personally found the need for it. If you would like to see a particular feature built, or if you'd like to contribute/collaborate, feel free to shoot me an email at thrvg1@gmail.com!
